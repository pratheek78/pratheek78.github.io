### Do you have a Support Server?
No. This project follows a strict RTFM rule(Read the fucking manual). This means that there wont be any support server, however if you have a question, feel free to post it in the [github issues tab](https://github.com/pratheek78/Ezebot-Open-Source/issues). Most of the commands will be covered here, and this Documentation will be updated as soon as theres an update to the bot.

>:warning:  This bot is still under heavy development, so it could go offline often
