# Quick Start
Start by inviting Ezebot to your server. It requires administration permissions, however the bot is very well protected so you can be sure that it wont backfire. You can find the invite on the home page. 

## Set your prefix
Start by setting your prefix to the desired one so that it does not conflict with other bots you might add. The default prefix is ``!``. Use the ``prefix`` command to set it. 

Example:
```
!prefix e!
```
This will set the prefix to ``e!``

To make sure the new prefix works, use the ``!ping`` command and change the prefix to the one you set earlier. It should reply with the bot's ping.


:::caution

It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to drag the bot's role to the top of the heirarchy in server settings!!!

## Bot Role
To prevent any errors, grant the bot's role every single permission available(even if you have admin enabled). This is done to prevent any errors in the backend which may ignore the admin perm which is already granted.
